Thoughts and notes on performing transfer-entropy analysis
==========================================================

Cave curvature
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
While bats may definitely be interacting with one another, they
still are most likely 'interacting'/responding with/to the cave's surface
the most. It'll be important to account for the cave's geometry while
analysing any kind of information theoretical metrics. 

Bat trajectories
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* What are the information metric strength for a single bat flying in the cave by itself
with the walls
* How does the information metric between bats change when you synthetically add another bat flying 
in the same volume?
* What are the information metrics amongst bats that are truly flying in groups? 


What data is needed
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Multiple single bat trajectories
* Multiple multi-bat trajectories 
* thermo-LiDAR alignment matrices

What we have now
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* 2018-08-17_P01_7000 first 25 frames ~8 bats
* 

What else can be done
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Digitisation work
-----------------
* 2018-08-17 - videos of single/few bats flying around in P00
* 



Caveats
~~~~~~~
* What happens when a bat leaves the scene - 
* What about species - will need to try and estimate this from the video and audio data from the 
flight and call behaviour.
