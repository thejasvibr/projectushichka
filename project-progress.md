# Project progress
This document will document progress made on various fronts, including some associated research work. 

## Week 1: 15-19/3

* Setting up this repository
* Decision to implement all data into a relational database (sqlite,mysql,etc) for data safety and consistency
* Initiation of work on inferring call direction using beam-shape models using approximate Bayesian computing. Ideas for a paper

## Week 2:  22-26/3 

* Cluster retreat (9-12am) for the whole week 
* Gave talk introducing the Ushichka dataset on 25/3
* Further work on inferring call direction using beam-shape models 
* Started inspection of the dataset/files that are spread across 4 smaller hard drives
	* Looking at redundancies between the 4 drives: in ```ushichka_docs/What is in the Ushichka dataset.ipynb``` notebook
* Looking up computers + 6 TB hard drives to be ordered

## Week 3: 29/3 - 02/4

* Decision to drop the idea of using a database management system as the learning curve may not be worth it. 
* 6TB hard drive delivered
