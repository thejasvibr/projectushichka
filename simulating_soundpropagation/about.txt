----------
This sub-repo has a toy workflow on how to simulate sound propagation
in Orlova Chuka using a smaller, simplified version of the 
whole cave LiDAR scan. 

In general, the idea is to load the mesh and then run the room simulation
in ```pyroomacoustics```. 

Right now the example STL file is 77 kB and is a massively simplified 
representation of the original LiDAR scan.
