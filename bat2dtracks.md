# Building 2D bat tracks

The 2d tracks of bats need to be generated from each of the video channels. This document will track my progress on 
the 2D tracking front. 













## Updates:

* 2021-06-18 : Ben Koger shared code used to track fruit bat blobs in the Kasanka flights. A bunch of interesting 
measurements can be made with the code - blob size, bounding rectangles - from which wing flapping data can also be 
extracted.
