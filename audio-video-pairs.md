# Audio-video pairs
This document will handle all the audio-video file pairs. It's not entirely straightforward on many days
as the number of video and audio files are different sometimes. This document will detail the pairing, 
and the reasons behind it. 

All pairs are listed by recording session.


### 2018-07-28 session 1: *file match explained*

Number of video files ```P000/(K1, K2, K3)```: 116,116,116
Number of audio files  ```actrackdata/wav/2018-07-28_001/```: 115

There is one less audio file than the number of video files - which file is missing? 
There is one video file (0000.TMC with 337 frames) which doesn't have a corresponding audio file - all other files are in correct file-order!.
