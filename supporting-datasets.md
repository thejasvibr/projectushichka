# Supporting data to be collected
*Date of document initiation: 2021-03-18*

Along with the three main data types in Ushichka (See [here](README.md)), 
there are some more supporting datasets that will arise, and still need
to be collected. Here I will outline the supporting data that needs to be collected. 

## 1.Microphone frequency response and directionality (urgent)
The Knowles SPU 0410 and SANKEN CO-100 microphones need to be calibrated for
their frequency response and directionality. The microphone properties need to 
be measured only with a  Fireface UC/ Fireface 802 soundcards as these
were the models used in the field season. 

It's important to replicate the calibration exercise carried out in the field, 
where the microphones were placed on a sheet of cardboard to mimic the effect
of placing microphones on cave walls. 

Given that Haus10 will soon be taken over by other groups, it's important to 
get a hold of the mics+speakers and use the space as early as possible. Perhaps
the calibration work needs to take utmost priority. 

## 2. Back-up camera intrinsic parameter estimates (low-priority)
I have camera intrinsic parameter estimates, based on video collected back in 2017(?),
and analysed by Ty Hedrick and Pranav Khandelwal. These estimates seem to provide
good 3D tracking right now, but they may need to be re-measured. It would be
good to repeat the measurements, but these are a somewhat low priority right now.
