# Objectives of the thermo-lidar alignment folder

* Julian's Bachelor thesis has a 'transformation' matrix which allows a conversion from the camera calibration space to the LiDAR space. 
* If the transformation matrix is correct - the 3D coordinates of the microphones should coincide very well with the surface of the LiDAR scan. 
* Here I will generate 3D coordinates for the microphones, transform them to
LiDAR space, and then check how well they corroborate.
