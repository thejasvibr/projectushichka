Meeting with Bastian, Julian and Thejasvi
2022-03-23 -- didn't take place on 2022-03-18

Things to discuss

* Is it worth making this into a conference/journal paper? The dataset and its challenges are unique enough to warrant so I feel 
* There's an issue of 8 pixels backprojection error - how could this be improved?
	* Space carving approach - is it worth following up? 

* GCPR deadline is 3rd June 2022 - is this
	 too short for a submission
	* with only the DMCP
	* with DMCP and space carving approach 

Discussion:

* Space carving approach would take too much time,
and also require more 'views' to generate sensible results
* It would make sense to perform the camera pose reconstruction
for multiple nights - also use microphone positions 
* Julian also brought up something about the KITTI dataset

Next meeting:
* 2022-04-06 10:00 next meeting 
* 2022-04-11 11:00 Julian's colloquium
