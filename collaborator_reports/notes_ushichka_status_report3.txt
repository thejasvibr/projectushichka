SFM Thermal-LiDAR alignment: Julian Jandeleidt, Bastian Goldluecke

Notes on 3rd report sent by Julian: 

* applied median filtering of all the pixels across the image stack for all cameras. 
* generated 'rectified images' -- what are these, are these the undistorted images? - Not clear
* created disparity maps, and is able to compare images from camera pairs.
	* ? is a higher disparity mean better matching, or the other way round?
	* disparity maps show the # of pixels that need to be shifted between image pairs to get the same/similar views. Allows a matching of features across images?

* Also referring to Julian's email: 
	* 'The microphones could help in aligning. However I presume that the actual "tack 	points" would need to be annotated manually, correct?
	Also they would need to be marked in the lidar scan to compute a transformation 	from thermal point cloud to lidar point cloud.'
	* My response: can't the microphone points be somehow aligned with the LiDAR points -- using a distance matrix or something like that?
	* "The result was a ceiling-of-a-cave like structure, but the “border lines” 
dominate the result, so a 2D view for illustration purposes is not practical. 
		* Which ceiling portion did he see - e.g. there's the pyramid on the ceiling that should be easily visible. 

Notes during/after the meeting (2021-09-10):
* Bachleor's project will run till end Sept. 

notes from the presentation 
* the disparity map was not sufficient to reconstruct the cave
* used classic examples of disparity datasets to check fi 3D positions could be extracted with his workflow - it worked. 
* facing issues to perform 3D reconstruction using classical methods
* Found a Master's thesis that had the same problem (IR data ) - a method using 'phase congruency' seems to work rather well in edge and corner detection 
* Disparity maps are built to build point clouds.
