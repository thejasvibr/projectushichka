SFM Thermal-LiDAR alignment: Julian Jandeleidt, Bastian Goldluecke

Notes on 3rd report sent by Julian: 

* applied median filtering of all the pixels across the image stack for all cameras. 
* generated 'rectified images' -- what are these, are these the undistorted images? - Not clear
* created disparity maps, and is able to compare images from camera pairs.
	* ? is a higher disparity mean better matching, or the other way round?
	* disparity maps show the # of pixels that need to be shifted between image pairs to get the same/similar views. Allows a matching of features across images?

* Also referring to Julian's email: 
	* 'The microphones could help in aligning. However I presume that the actual "tack 	points" would need to be annotated manually, correct?
	Also they would need to be marked in the lidar scan to compute a transformation 	from thermal point cloud to lidar point cloud.'
	* My response: can't the microphone points be somehow aligned with the LiDAR points -- using a distance matrix or something like that?
