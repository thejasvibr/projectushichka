Giray report comments:

Title: 
The title is misleading, as the project doesn't deal with 'optimisation' directly (Of course to perform matching one needs to optimise various things like projection errors etc). How about  
	* Matching 3d trajectories from multi-view 2D trajectories
	* Multi-view 2D and 3D trajectory matching 
	or something along these lines -- the focus is on 'matching' or something which evokes this idea.
	
Supervisor list: 
	* Please change my affiliation to 'Centre for the Advanced Study of Collective Behaviour, Uni Konstanz' (I only have a guest contract at the MPIO)

Keywords: 
	* could also add 'correspondence matching' 
Abstract: 
	* Also include the fact that you handle two sub-problems - where the 2D labels are known (all points are assigned to one 2D traj.), and where the trajecotry labels are unknown - where the points do not have any labels associated. 

Introduction:
	* '2D points can be reflected back into 3D space.' - do you mean 'projected back into 3D space'?
	* 'An example of epipolar geometry can be seen at Figure 4.' -- do you mean figure 1?
	* Last paragraph: 'In this paper, I implemented a method for matching the corresponding 2D trajectories with another method which reconstructs 3D trajectories based on matched 2D trajectories.' -- here, spend some more time focusing on the 2 sub-problems you actually solved!

Methods:
	* 'To start with, OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) ...' - this is a fairly well known package, and can shorten the sentence by only including the reference directly. ( it is very cool, but think of the reader who's familiar with your field, it'll take away their limited attention to read all these already known details). 
	* The methods section can be split up into more subsections:
		3.1 --> deals with known 2D labels
		* 3.1.1 proposed algorithm to match labelled 2D points
		3.2 --> deals with only points without labels -- this is the 3.3 'auxiliary' section. Don't treat it as 'auxiliary' -- it is a 		very cool part of the project you've worked on!!
	* 

Data creation: 
rename it to 'synthetic data'. 'Data creation' sounds weird/unusual

	* This segment should go in the 'Methods' section - and not come after Results. 
	* Give a table with the Go Pro Hero 3 parameters (focal length, distortion coeffs. etc) - so a reader can get an idea what kind of camera it is. 

Corresponding 2D Trajectory Matching:

	* '..which has zero mean distribution' --> '..which has zero mean distribution in pixels' (mention the physical units)

Disclaimers:

	* 'During the implementation and gathering the results, versions of Python 3.9, and OpenCV-python 4.5.2.54 are used. The implemented
methods are not tested with other versions. Therefore, with other versions, the results may differ.' --  this part is not really relevant to the science. Mention the package and Python versions in the methods-  it should be enough. Delete this part otherwise. This section is more relevant on the docs page of the software project - and not so much in the 'science' part of this report. 
	* 'Furthermore....' - this part can be moved down to the 'Future directions' section. The sentence doesn't really have any 'disclaimer' type content in it and so doesn't fit here. 

Discussion:
	* discuss the results and some poitns that are particularly interesting - and why it may be so. eg. 1) Even with 0 noise I see that 100% matching is never achieved - why is this? 2) the matching actually doesn't seem to be very affected by the amount of noise -- this itself is rather interesting - why is this? 

Issues: 
	* Use the SI convention and use 'dots' instead of commas! eg. 0,0354mm --> 0.0354 mm -- Also, looking Figure 7 - shouldn't the units be in m ( 0.0354 m)? Which unit is correct - check this as it makes a big difference :p 


Add a 'Future Work' header and include the stuff you'd like to implement in the future (work on 'real' datasets, and some of the other algorithms not handled in this project report).


Figure 1:
	* The figure caption by itself isn't enough to tell the reader how to understand the figure. Is this image taken from ref. 3 - if yes, then state it clearly. 
	In general, try to imagine that the reader will read the figure independently of the main text and then write the caption. 
Figure 2:
	* Could you try reducing the size of the image? Remember this is *your* report - and so try to give more prominence to your work and results :)! 
Figure 4:
	* The figure needs captions. See comments made for Figure 1
Figure 5:
	* See above. 
	* In general I tend to avoid bar-plots. A cleaner way tho visualise this is to use a line plot that connect all 3,5,and 7 object data points. Just a suggestion, I know you don't have much timek, but just something to keep in mind for next time.
