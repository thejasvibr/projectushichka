* Used the phase congruency method to find outlines and distinct points
* used epipolar lines from camera calibraiton to find correspondences of points between camera views
* finds matching points along the left wall - prob. because it's closest to the entrance - and there's more thermal variation? 
* Finding regions that are common to all 3 cameras is useful to find very robust points 


Also bring up the paragraph for the LiDAR-thermal alignment.

* phase congruency approach, systematically train deep learning algorithms to generate depth maps - ie. generate aligned datasets. Placing markers in the cave 
*
