Giray project meeting 2021-12-16 (Hemal, Giray, Thejasvi)

* Started working with Starling data
* Began working on Kalman filter in the tracking 
and also with more objects (20 objects)
* Achieved 100% matching with Kalman Filter(KF) 
* Current implementation has 3D projection and verification with Kalman 
happening serially (Kalman used to 'check' the 3D projection of
a single matched pair)
	* New suggestion is to keep all 'valid' pairs for each point, 
	, store the pairs, and generate the 'best' 3D point. Run through
	all frames and store the potential pairs + best 3D point. 
	Then independently run a Kalman filter to verify the points into 
	a trajectory, and if the 3D point is 'off' - then check for the 
	alternate 3D projections for that point on that frame. 

* Giray tried to run synthetic data using cameras with distortion
and saw a weird unexplainable 7% drop in matching accuracy -- 
we decided it's not worth going into. Let's assume the user provides
undistorted x,y points (having done object tracking on undistorted
images!!!!)
* 


? in the 20 object scenario -were all the objects in the scene all
the time? -- yes, for now all the synthetic data is visible on 
both cameras on all frames

? What are Giray's timelines - submit by 1st week of Feb.
