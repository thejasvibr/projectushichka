Julian meeting 2021-10-07

* used the raw video without humans to generate
common features
* also took the microphone positions 
on the cave wall and tried to register the 
LiDAR
* Even with the new microphone positions and the refined ICP feature matching of the cave surfaces the camera positions are still not as good as expected
* The current alignment, even with 
microphone points is not too perfect. The 3D points are aligned with the LiDAR surface, but the estimated camera positions are still off 
* one option is to use stereo algorithms for thermal images 
* The depth maps from the thermal images is relatively questionable 
* BG suggests to use an iterative backprojection of the LiDAR into the thermal cameras - and see which camera positions generate the best fit - look at the kinect paper
* JJ submission deadline is end of October
