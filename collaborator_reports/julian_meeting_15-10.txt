* Did backprojection of the LiDAR mesh onto the thermal cameras
* there were some fixed-pattern noise that 
JJ discovered, and removing it helped a lot. Perhaps the fixed-pattern noise affected 
even previous work? Vertical lines. 
	* These vertical lines actually created 
	a lot of false matches in the previous 
* ?? the thermal camera 3D point projections and the LiDAR need a scaling factor of 1.5 to get them to match! --- where is this coming from?
