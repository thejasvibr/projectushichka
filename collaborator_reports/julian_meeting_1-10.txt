Julian meeting 2021-10-01

* JJ presented some initial camera alignments - very promising. 

* The camera relative heights are okay, though there does seem to be some skew in the global positioning of the camera array. This may actually be a fixable problem using the manual microphone positions!!

* Wanted some files without people in the data 
	* needs some files with only the cave/ or a few bats at most
	* MICROPHONE X-Y COORDINATES
