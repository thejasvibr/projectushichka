Julian meeting 2022-04-26
=========================
* meeting to discuss
	* manuscript progress
	* GUI progress
	* what computational experiments to run on the tool to show its accuracy/utility
* Manuscript progress:
	* Not much progress. 
	* Thursday 28/4 morning sessiong with Julian to work on introduction. 
* GUI progress 
	* one tiny bug - could be fixed by next week. 
* Computational experiments
	Inputs:
		* No need to make a new LiDAR mesh - just choose points that are stationary and don't change from night to night
		* Thermal camera data :
			* DLT coeffieicnts
			* Set of videos for each video don't have people 
			* JJ needs one image as a csv file for each camera on each 
	Experiments:
		* JJ will do all the experiments - playing around with the effect of main camera
			* output 3 transformation matrices per night
				* JJ will analyse 2D reprojection error
				* TB will analyse microphone alignment error (raw and post-icp)
		* For JJ's thesis, K2 used as the primary camera
	Docs/Code:
		* Code hosted at the ushichka project page: https://github.com/ushichka/dmcp
		* ReadtheDocs
