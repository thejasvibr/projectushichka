Julian, Bastian, Thejasvi meeting 2022-05-10
============================================

* 7 nights analysed 
* Some nights are 'okay', and some are *very* off. 
* JJ checked did some investigation. 
    * Maybe one possibility is that the 3D annotated
points are all very planar and that's why there's a problem 
    * BG wondered if it's a software bug - JJ says he
checked his implementation with an existing one - so 
doesn't think it's a problem with implementation. 
    * JJ wonders if the intrinsics of the estimated 
cameras is the problem. 
* JJ didn't include undistortion - BG thinks it may play a role
* JJ also thinks instead of a 3D interactive display, it may
be better to just have a 2D RGB display of the LiDAR scene 
next to the depth map. '

Solutions:
* Do the undistorting
*
