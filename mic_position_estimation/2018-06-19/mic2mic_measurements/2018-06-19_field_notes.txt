## Mic-to-mic measurements

	* Expected measurement error in mic-to-mic distances: +/- 0.01 m
	* The mic-to-mic distances for only 4 microphones have been measured

## Other notes

	* Measurements taken at 2018-06-19,23:00: Relative humidity: 92.9%, Temperature: 12.7 C

	* No explicit mic2mic distances taken. Tristar array used which means channels 9-12 are in tristar configuration. 
	* However, no explicit mention of channel order in tristar array (if it is 9,10,11,12 in cc or anti-cc direction)

	* Some microphones fell to the ground: microphones 1,2,4 fell to the ground - and their final estimated positions may actually reflect this!
