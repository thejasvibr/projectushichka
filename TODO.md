# TO-DO 

This document has a list of concrete things that need to be done. The sub-headings are somewhat arbitrary

## Put RAW LiDAR, audio and video files onto the master hard disk 
* Remember to check that the oldest file is transferred, with all of its metadata intact!!!! 
* Use the already available Ushichka file lists

## Microphone calibration: urgent
* Frequency response and directionality measurements of all mics used in the Ushichka dataset

## Try out bat tracklet detection: medium
* Check out different methods of tracking bats in the videos. See [tracking notes](./brainstorm25.md)

## Optimise beam-shape numerical evaluation code.
